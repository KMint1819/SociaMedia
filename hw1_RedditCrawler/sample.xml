    <title>What's going on with the new coronavirus in China? How does a completely new virus manifest?</title>
    <content>Aljazeera estimates that within Wuhan there could be up to 1723 cases, with small new instances in Thailand and Japan. Regardless of how many, and where, how does a completely new virus suddenly appear? Is it a mutation of an old virus? A completely new one somehow? If so, how does this occur?</content>
    <comment>Didn't they do this before? Deny the disease is happening and then it spreads and it's their fault.</comment>
    <comment>That’s how it starts in WWZ the book anyway</comment>
    <comment>China claims no person-to-person transmissions and there are only 50 reported cases... but outsiders say that is B.S. It's starting to be reported in other countries... that implies there has to be a much larger number actually infected. And a larger number of infected means person-to-person transmission.</comment>
