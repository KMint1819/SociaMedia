Nice job OP</comment></post><post><title>This sub over the past couple of months. (no shame, everyone loves a bit of flexing)</title><content /><comment>I'm 2/3 of the way there. I recently switched back from the Apple ecosystem. I bought Galaxy Buds+ and an S20 ultra. But I had my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier from when I had a Samsung phone before. It still works pretty well actually.</comment><comment>Same actually, my galaxy buds arrived literally 10 minutes ago</comment><comment>I upgraded from the S3 Frontier to the Galaxy Watch. The battery life is much better. Runs smoother as well. My wife uses hers much more than I do and she's getting two days worth on a single charge.</comment></post></xml>
